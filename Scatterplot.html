                The correlation coefficient for the number of students was .076, 
                implying a positive relationship and the lowest theoretical strength 
                of the variables. The correlation coefficient for the student-staff ratio 
                was -0.21, which means a negative correlation and higher theoretical strength. 
                The correlation coefficient for the percent of international students was .27, 
                which has a positive relationship with the highest theoretical strength of the 
                variables. The correlation coefficient for the percent of female students was -0.127, 
                meaning a negative correlation and lower theoretical strength. The correlation 
                coefficient is similar to the scatterplot since when there is a positive correlation 
                coefficient, the data looks like it is increasing overall, and when there is a negative 
                correlation, there is an overall decrease in the data. Although correlation coefficients 
                can be a great tool for looking at trends in data, things like outliers and the sample 
                size can impact the correlation coefficient. </p>
