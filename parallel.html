		<h1>Citations, Research, and Teaching Have a Large Influence</h1>
        <p>There was no need to standardize the data for the parallel coordinates plot 
            because the original scale still allows you to interpret the data. 
            From the unstandardized data, you can gain a sense of understanding as to the 
            overall trend of how the variables between the top 200 and last 200 compare.

            The variable for citations, research, and teaching showed the most significant difference 
            between the top and last 200. The last 200 scores averaged around 20% for all three variables 
            while the top 200 was much higher and mainly stayed above 50%.
